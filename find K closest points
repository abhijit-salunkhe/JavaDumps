// Find K closest points in a plane


You can do it in O(n), but you have to avoid heaps. 
First build an array with the distances to the origin and the corresponding point. O(n) 
Then find the Kth largest distance using the Selection algorithm. O(n) 
The K-1 smallest distances are to the left of the Kth distance, in no particular order. 

So the total is O(n).
